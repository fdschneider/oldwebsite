title: Announcing jekyll-lablog v0.2
date: "2015-03-22"
author: Flo Schneider
categories: blog
teaser: "After a while of leaving the project at rest, I finally pushed some features that I already developed a while ago, into version 0.2 of [the jekyll-lablog template](https://github.com/fdschneider/jekyll-lablog)."

A [demo and documentation can be found here](https://fdschneider.github.io/jekyll-lablog/).

For more than half a year now, I use it to generate a slim static website to browse my over 200 notes on articles I was reading, conferences and seminars I was attending, on my thoughts and ideas, and my code development. It helps me to manage my projects in tasklists and organise my notes using tags.

I believe it is a great way to manage notes that allows to be independent of third party services like Onenote and Evernote. I gladly share it with you. Any comments, feature requests or bug reports are welcome (via e-mail or [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/fdschneider/jekyll-lablog/issues) or pull request).

If you want to get started, just install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and clone the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/fdschneider/jekyll-lablog).

**New features:**

- New **typeset using Open Sans and minimalist icons** (compiled using [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/)).
- A dark, **responsive menu**. It smartly provides direct links to all pages or posts that have a `menu:` variable specified in their yml header.
- Revised **footer**, including links and icons and an RSS/Atom feed.
- Manage your **projects** using a layout file that collects all content that has a specific **tag**.
- Automatically **collapse completed tasks** (toggle switch will follow).
- Enable **multiple tasklists**, that are compiled into a long one.
